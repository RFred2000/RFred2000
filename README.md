## About Me

I'm a software generalist with a keen focus on honing my skills in web design.

Having cut my teeth working as a systems software engineer, I have experience in various topics. From writing Systems Verilog to GPU accelerated algorithms to JavaScript server code. 

Given this diverse background, I bring a unique perspective to web design. This is, an ability to look beyond the code needed to accomplish a specific task and onto what makes a system work as a whole.
